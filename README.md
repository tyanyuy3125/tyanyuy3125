Third-year undergraduate @ School of Software, Tsinghua University.

My research focuses on **physically based computer graphics** and **computational geometry**, which is supported by my background in theoretical and computational physics.

I have been collaborating with Prof. Feng Xu @ THU and Prof. Shuang Zhao @ UIUC on Monte Carlo methods for solving partial differential equations. I am currently visiting Prof. Toshiya Hachisuka @ UWaterloo.

**29 March, 2025** - My first-author technical paper has been conditionally accepted to SIGGRAPH 2025! This has never happened in the history of undergraduate graphics research at Tsinghua University. Please stay tuned, the paper and code will be released soon.
